There are strange goings-on in Sheffield city centre. Every night, like clockwork, the Crucible theatre empties en masse, and the patrons gather in Tudor Square, where lines of riot police and a royal parade assemble to meet them. This is *Camelot: The Shining City*.

The brainchild of Slung Low, a theatre company specialising in immersive, outdoor theatre, Camelot begins like any other play, but the audience move out into Tudor Square for the second act, and up to the Peace Gardens for the final climactic battle. A near-future Arthurian re-imagining, Camelot is brutal and gripping, both in terms of the stage action and the handling of ideas. An enormous cast of 150 is well-used to realise the legendary story.

Between the large number of local people included in the cast, the revolutionary aspirations of the plot, and the egalitarian choice to stage the play where people conduct their everyday business, this really is theatre for the people. That’s an idea central to the ethos of Slung Low.

One of the play’s masterstrokes is to set the play exactly where it is being performed. When the queen steps out to deliver a speech to the Crucible theatre, she really is delivering a speech to the Crucible theatre. Director Alan Lane believes the Crucible to be one of the finest theatres outside London, and this soft spot for the north permeates the script. When ‘the shining city’ is saluted at the climax of the play, you look around the Peace Gardens, at the buildings of the city, bathed in the light of a summertime sunset, and truly believe it.

This isn’t to say there are no flaws. Particularly in the second act, it is at times hard to figure out where one should be looking. Thought has been given to addressing this problem; lines of riot police gesture with their truncheons, and spotlights specially installed on the roof of the adjacent Lyceum pick out points of interest.

The play is a balancing act; it cannot sacrifice its modern elements without foregoing realism, nor its historical elements without sacrificing relevance. The end result just about works, but it’s still jarring for characters to be firing assault rifles in one scene, or beckoning the audience to visit a website on their phones, only to then deliver dialogue that could have been picked straight from Arthurian legend.

But these flaws are forgivable, in part due to the guts of the production and the sheer scope of its vision. Camelot is a triumph, for the Crucible and for Sheffield.

There are only two productions which, after seeing, I have been sufficiently impressed to see a second time. *Camelot: The Shining City* is one of those two.
