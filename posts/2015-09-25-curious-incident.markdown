*Based on the much-loved novel, the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time explores themes of family, being different and the struggle for independence that will be familiar to any eager fresher exploring the unfamiliar city of Sheffield.

The play recently completed a hit Broadway run and is now touring nationally. Joshua Hackett spoke to Joshua Jenkins about playing the lead, Christopher…*

**What’s the main challenge in putting a novel like this one on the stage?**

I think the biggest challenge is getting the audience inside Christopher’s mind. The book is told through his eyes, so we have to make that theatrically interesting. In this production, we’ve chosen to do that with music, lighting, projections and especially physical theatre.

Whenever Christopher feels overwhelmed, or confused, or anxious, we portray that with these mechanisms – it means the play really does have the production values of an enormous West End show!

**And what do you think it is that makes this novel work well on stage?**

It’s fundamentally a beautiful story. It’s based on these beautiful themes of family, love and difference that we can all relate to. There are many musicals but not many plays with these kinds of production values. Having those gives us the freedom to really do the story justice.

**What do you want people will take away from the play?**

For me, the most important thing is how we as a society treat those who are different. To be different is okay – it’s good, even. That was the message I took when I read the book.

Every audience member will be able to point at a particular scene and take away something personal to them – I think that’s the beauty of it.

**The author Mark Haddon famously disagreed with the description of Christopher as “autistic”. Will your portrayal be one of a textbook autistic?**

The idea of Christopher being on the autistic spectrum is never mentioned in the book, or indeed the play – only in the marketing. It’s nonetheless fair to say that he possesses the traits and qualities of someone who is.

<blockquote><q>I tried to research autism as much as I could.</q></blockquote>

I tried to research autism as much as I could. I read up on it, I visited some schools in London and chatted with pupils on the autistic spectrum, along with their parents and teachers.

But while we are portraying Christopher as autistic, the play isn’t just about a boy on the autistic spectrum – it’s so much more than that.

**Out of the roles you’ve played before, are there any that have been particularly useful in helping you prepare?**

There’s not much I’ve done before that could prepare me for a role this unique, especially in terms of the physical demands. What might be a page of dialogue can translate into a ten minute movement sequence. We’re working with Frantic Assembly – one of the best physical theatre companies in the business – to work that out.

I trained at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and in Swansea before that – I like to think that it’s because of the fantastic people who trained me that I’m able to take on challenging roles like this.

**How exactly are you externalising Christopher’s internal world?**

It’s a very technical show for the entire ensemble. The physical aspects are most challenging; standing up or moving at just the right time to cue the lights or the projections. It’s very structured and regulated, and over the six week rehearsal process, we worked on those parts time and time again to lock them down.

Working in that regimented way is appropriate for Christopher’s personality; he doesn’t like a break of routine.

<blockquote><q>I feel very lucky, taking this wonderful production on the road.</q></blockquote>

Every morning we did a boot camp to get us all physically fit; sit-ups and press ups and all these other horrible things. For the rest of the mornings we rehearsed the play itself, and then in the afternoon we’d look at the themes of the story and study those in detail. It was a very unique rehearsal process.

**How has the tour been so far?**

I feel very lucky, taking this wonderful production on the road. Even though we might be nine months into the tour, visiting brand new cities and venues keeps it exciting and fresh.

**Any highlights?**

So many! Personally, it would have to be performing at the Millenium Centre in Cardiff. I’m Welsh myself, so I had all my family and friends in the audience.

**Have you been to Sheffield before?**

I’ve never been, but I’ve heard nothing but amazing things so far and of course everyone knows about the theatre scene. We’re looking forward to a bit of exploration.
