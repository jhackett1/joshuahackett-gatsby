*Spotlight* probably shouldn’t exist. Systematic sexual abuse by priests in turn-of-the-century Boston and the intricate mundanity of a newspaper investigation into the cover-up are not easy premises to work with.

But director Tom McCarthy has taken these difficult subjects and crafted something rather interesting.

Like the real-life investigation it chronicles, *Spotlight* is determined not to be a hatchet job – treating its subject matter with respect and a deferential distance. The film is so zealous in this that truly emotional moments are sparse. The few that do occur, like Mark Ruffalo’s outburst toward the climax of the film’s two hour running time, approach (but never arrive at) hamminess.

For a film that rests so heavily on emotions, *Spotlight* seems unsure who the audience should be investing in. We don’t see enough of the journalists when they aren’t on the job to truly identify with them and their struggle, and nor do we see enough of the victims outside the interview situation. While the film is ostensibly an ensemble piece, it’s only really Ruffalo who captures the audience.

While this respect is certainly due, given the difficult subject matter, it does rob us of a few needed cathartic moments. We never see any payoff when the investigation is finally published. Its impact is only hinted at through a chorus of ringing phones.

We last see Cardinal Law (Len Cariou) – the closest thing *Spotlight* has to an antagonist – looking pleased with himself at a charity gala. Surely it wouldn’t be much of a departure from history for the filmmakers to slip in the cardinal’s worried face as he reads over the morning papers?

*Spotlight* excels in conveying the idea of a city in the grip of a religious institution. Church buildings literally loom large in the background of the film’s most memorable shots. The film masterfully demonstrates how virtually the whole city has become complicit in a cover-up that no one wanted.

Some interesting concepts don’t get enough screen time. The notion that sexual abuse by priests is a distinct psychiatric phenomenon is an intriguing one, but is glossed quickly over in the film.

Sharing a writer in Josh Singer with 2013’s Julian Assange thriller The Fifth Estate, *Spotlight* is one of a small bunch of films still parading journalism as a public good. It does well to critique the way local newspapers operate; living minute-to-minute rather than paying attention to the larger patterns going on under their noses.

All that said, *Spotlight* manages to hold the attention and somehow weaves a compelling narrative out of a thoroughly disheartening premise. The filmmakers believe this story needs to be told, and told well, and so the film succeeds.
