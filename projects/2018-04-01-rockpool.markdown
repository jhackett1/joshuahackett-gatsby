Working with a UX designer, I delivered a bespoke Wordpress theme and several plugins, integrated with external platforms like Salesforce.

I made use of the new Wordpress editor - Gutenberg - to give Rockpool the ability to create rich, creatively-designed pages without needing to write any code.

Using the React-based Gutenberg API, I produced a variety of reusable "blocks" deployable on any page.
