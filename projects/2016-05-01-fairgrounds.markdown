Prompted by the [sudden appearance of the Star Flier](http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/pictures-massive-220ft-carousel-ride-goes-up-in-sheffield-city-centre-1-7798625) in Sheffield city centre one day in early 2016, I explored the history of these enormous transportable thrill rides, and what their proliferation means for the traditional funfairs of our childhoods.

During my investigation, I came across Carters' Steam Fair, who restore and operate original Victorian rides, touring around the south of England every summer.
