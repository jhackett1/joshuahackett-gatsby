Science Brainwaves' old website had been designed at some point in 2010 or 2011, and was close to breaking point. It relied on several esoteric plugins which had not been updated in years, and the design was dated, to say the least.

I drastically simplified the site design, incorporating large photography of events and projects, making key information about ongoing projects and volunteering easier to find, and added biographies and contact details of the organisation's leaders.

The website was also made fully responsive and integrated with Science Brainwaves' mailing list system.
