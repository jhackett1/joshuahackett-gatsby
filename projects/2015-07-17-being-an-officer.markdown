In my role as a digital content producer for Sheffield Students' Union, I produced diverse content, especially video, to support key campaigns. One of these major campaigns is the annual officer elections. Encouraging students to nominate themselves and vote in the elections are major objectives for the SU each year.

I produced eight episodes - each featuring a single SU officer, and produced a variety of long and short form edits for distribution on a variety of platforms. Some were edited to in favour of a "nominate yourself" message, others for a "vote now" message.
