*Smoke Mag* used to be a termly publication. It was printed A4 format, and was normally designed by a full-time designer. Content also overlapped heavily with student newspaper *the QH*.

The goal of this project was to return to basics, using audience research to build a fit-for-purpose student magazine which looked professional, had a clear remit and which was easy for student volunteers to assemble every month.

We arrived at a 28-page A5 magazine, published monthly. The magazine contains comment, music, lifestyle, fashion and arts sections, each with its own distinctive colour. The design is deliberately modular, so that students with minimal design training can customise it to fit their purposes.
