Journo Resources offers a support network to journalists at the very start of their career. They offer vetted lists of graduate schemes, information on salaries, and career advice.

They were struggling to scale an out-of-the-box Wordpress theme to cope with the amount of different services they offered and the 

Their brand was well-developed and was displayed well offline and on social media, but the website fell behind.

My overhaul had three key aims:

* Clearly signpost new users to the services they'll find most useful
* Make sponsored content a more attractive proposition to partner orgs
* Properly showcase the Journo Resources brand

I ended up creating a Wordpress child theme so that changes could be trialled and tested bit by bit, rather than in one big risky release.
