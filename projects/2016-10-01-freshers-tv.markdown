*Freshers' TV* is a staple of the student television calendar: a live programme featuring highlights from student TV stations across the country from freshers' week, along with unique special features.

My application for Forge TV to host the 2015 show was accepted, and given our city's musical heritage, we went for a musical theme. We lined up two music acts to perform live during the show, and navigated the organisational and technical hurdles that posed.

We cultivated a much stronger relationship with our Students' Union - we laid out the value such a project could bring to them, and were granted access to additional funding, which went toward vital equipment purchases.

Hosting *Freshers' TV* forced us to leapfrog Forge TV's development - we compressed several years of equipment purchases and training into the two month lead time between being announced as the host and broadcast day.

The learning and resources gained in hosting *Freshers' TV* put Forge TV in an incredibly strong position, on campus and nationally. We formed incredibly strong relationships with the SU's technical staff and sister student media outlet, Forge Radio.
