The *Quintin Hogg* newspaper is the latest in a long tradition of student publications at the University of Westminster. It focuses on news, current affairs and sport, and is complemented by sister publication *Smoke Mag*, which focuses on culture and lifestyle.

The redesign was conducted over summer and was intended to be a complete departure from the previous look. This was partly for simple modernisation, but also an opportunity to bring the *QH* in line with new joint student media brand guidelines.

A tabloid format was selected for convenience and cost, and a unique, modern tabloid look was developed, making use of bold headlines and crossheads, colourful pullquotes and strong presence of brand colours. A five-column grid was selected for all pages, to avoid the mishmash of designs that had afflicted earlier incarnations of the *QH*.

 The new templates are interpreted by student volunteers, who adapt and remix them when producing each issue.
