This year, I used React, Node and Express to build a conference engagement platform called Conferoo.

Delegates could use a web app to build a personal agenda of the events on offer, respond to polls and see updates from the organisers. Organisers could extract insights to shape the conference in real time.

To make things tougher, the venue had poor internet access, so the app needed to retry API requests in the background until success. I used [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) principles to build a robust, offline-first experience for users.

The application interacts with a Node.js backend via an API, with data saved and retrieved from a MongoDB database.
