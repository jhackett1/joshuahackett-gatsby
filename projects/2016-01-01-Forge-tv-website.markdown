While working with Forge TV as a student at the University of Sheffield, I was tasked with rebuilding the station's website, incorporating modern design and usability trends.

I built a theme for the Wordpress platform which aims to present video content with minimal distraction, while also providing several landing pages and allowing website users to publish blog posts.

Through subtle visual humour and audience-savvy copy, the website includes the light-hearted humour inherent to Forge TV's brand. 404 pages are one example of this.
