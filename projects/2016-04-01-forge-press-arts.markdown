I was elected arts editor of Forge Press, the University of Sheffield's student-led fortnightly newspaper. I gathered features, interviews and reviews for four pages per issue, supervising volunteer contributors and copy-editors.

I also brought a new online-first focus to the section, commissioning and developing [exclusive online-only content](http://forgetoday.com/this-city-is-a-stage/). These often relied on video, audio and photo galleries to augment the narrative, in the style made famous by the *New York Times*' landmark 2012 piece, [Snow Fall](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/).
