I was asked to create a static HTML landing page to promote a start-up's funding drive.

Working with a designer, I created a collection of robust, reusable components that could be remixed into any order, with any content included in them, so that this and future landing pages could be quickly prototyped.

I used the Gatsby static site generator, which allowed me to implement each reusable layout block as a React component, but still benefit from a static HTML output.

The aggressive performance optimisations of the Gatsby generator were vital to keeping load times under control - especially for longer page layouts.

I created a companion design system which catalogued all the blocks on offer, suggestions of how to use them and code samples.
