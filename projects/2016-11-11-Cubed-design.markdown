outline: I worked as production editor of Cubed Gamers, a monthly national gaming magazine.
quickFacts:
  - Colourful, attention-grabbing style
  - For games, appropriate imagery can be tough to find
  - Each design shows each game at its best but fits in with the publication brand

*Cubed Gamers* is a monthly gaming magazine start-up. After a long online-only existence, it recently celebrated its first anniversary as a print publication.

The magazine publishes a selection of reviews, features, news and comment pieces. As part of a small team, I prepare several double-page spreads per issue across all these content strands: editing copy, sourcing images from game publishers and creating print-ready designs.
