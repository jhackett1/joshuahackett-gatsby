In spring 2015, I served as producer of *Forge Debates*, a two-part live debate staged as a key part of our coverage of Sheffield Students' Union's annual elections.

This was a first for student media, since Students' Union staff had previously held their own debates.

Since none of us had any formal training in the television industry, we had to invent new solutions to every problem (How do we get good, radio friendly sound? How do we manage the gaps between debates? Where should we position cameras?), learning as we went along, inspired only by things we'd seen on TV.

Successfully executing this concept required over a dozen crew members and coordination of nearly thirty on-screen guests.

A year later, we planned the second annual edition of the show, which was broadcast in full HD for the first time, and was the most viewed programming of the semester. I'm happy to see that they have become a much-loved fixture of Forge electin coverage.
